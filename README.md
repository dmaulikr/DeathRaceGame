In game thrid person screenshot of the machine on the anti-grav track.

##TODO:
* Add AI (in progress)
* Fog in the distance
* Add enum class for RacePlayer status
* Fix issue with car clipping through track. -> Instead just have taller walls that go under the track a little and not as harshly sloped tracks. Create a developers guide for standards like these!
* Orient boost panels with nearest trackPoint's tangent
* signal when all boostPanels/Track are done initializing to start the game
