# ThridPersonPaperEngine
Code for various types of player manipulation with a third person camera. 

The main focus is recreating the intense, high speed, antigravity physics in the 2003 Gamecube game F Zero GX.

The latest demo can be found here https://youtu.be/dnxTFggXW90 with more to follow on my channel.

##TODO:
* Make more tracks/props
* Tweak AI (in progress)
* Fog in the distance
* signal when all boostPanels/Track are done initializing to start the game (put this in an abstract class)
* Add more sound effects and music (in progress)
* Minimap in bottom left/right based on racers and trackPoints
